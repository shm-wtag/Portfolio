        I'm probably not the typical designer positioned behind an Illustrator
        artboard adjusting pixels, but I design. Immersed in stylesheets
        tweaking font sizes and contemplating layouts is where you'll find me
        (~_^). I'm committed to creating fluent user experiences while staying
        fashionable.

        In building JavaScript applications, I'm equipped with just the right
        tools, and can absolutely function independently of them to deliver
        fast, resilient solutions optimized for scale â€” performance and
        scalabilty are priorities on my radar.
