        <p>
          I'm probably not the typical designer positioned behind an Illustrator
          artboard adjusting pixels, but I design. Immersed in stylesheets
          tweaking font sizes and contemplating layouts is where you'll find me
          (~_^). I'm committed to creating fluent user experiences while staying
          fashionable.

        <p>
          In building JavaScript applications, I'm equipped with just the right
          tools, and can absolutely function independently of them to deliver
          fast, resilient solutions optimized for scale â€” performance and
          scalabilty are priorities on my radar.
